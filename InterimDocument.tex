According to \cite{Roberts2000CompleteJava2Certification}(Chapter 1, page 6): An identifier is a name used by a programmer to variable, method, package, class, interfaces or label. Keywords and reserved words can't be used as  identifiers. It must begin with a letter, a dollar sign, or an underscore; identifiers are case sensitive. Identifiers are tokens (also called symbols) which name as language entities. Each variable has a name by which it is identified in the program.
