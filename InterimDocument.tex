\section{File Format}
\label{sec:file}

A file format is a specific way that information is encoded for storage in a computer file. There are different kinds of file formats for different kinds of information. Some file formats are designed for very particular sorts of data.\\
{\bf Syntax :} The form or structure of the expressions, statements, and program units.\\
{\bf Semantic :} The meaning of the expressions, statement, and program units. 	\\

{\bf The syntax} :\\\\
$<line 1>$ : comments\\
$<Day>$, $<Outlook>$, $<Temperature>$, $<Humidity>$, $<Wind>$, $<Play>$\\
$<Day>$:= $<type Integer >$ $<values : (numbers)>$\\
$<Outlook>$:= $< type String >$  $<values : (sunny, overcast, rain)>$\\
$<Temperature>$:= $< type String >$  $<values : (hot, mild, cool)>$\\
$<Humidity>$:= $< type String >$  $<values : (high, normal )>$\\
$<Wind>$:= $< type String >$  $<values : (weak, strong)>$\\
$<Play>$:= $< type String >$  $<values : (no,yes)>$\\

\begin{enumerate}



\item The first line is a comment, hash symbol signifies a comment and the program reads the first line ignores it. 
\item The second line will reads the number of attribute from the given training set.
\item The program splits the attributes explicitly in second line by using commas and space to separate each attributes in training set. 
\item The program will read the first column $<Day>$ attribute from the training set with their possible values.
\item The program will read the second column$<Outlook>$ attribute from the training set with their possible values.
\item The program will read the third column $<Temperature>$ attribute from the training set with their possible values.
\item The program will read the fourth column $<Humidity>$ attribute from the training set with their possible values.
\item The program will read the fifth column $<Wind>$ attribute from the training set with their possible values. 
\item The program will read the Target attribute $<Play>$ from the training set with their possible values.

\end{enumerate}

{\bf Restrictions}

\begin{itemize}

\item The first line of a program has to be ignored as comment.
\item The first column is defined as an Integer and others are Strings.
\item The number of possible values should be same as the number of attributes.
\item The values in the last column should only be ``yes' or ``no'.
\item The first column should be x1={sunny,overcast,rain}.
\item The second column should be x2 ={hot, mild, cool}.
\item The third column should be x3 ={high, normal}
\item The fourth column should be x4={weak, strong}
\item The last column (target attribute) should be x5={yes, no}\\\\


{\bf Example format:}\\
# Example from [Mitchell, Machine Learning], Chapter 3, Page 59\\
The above line is a commented line, the program ignores the line.

Day, outlook, temperature, humidity, wind, play
The above line is the second line in the program, where the attributes are separated using comma's and space. 
 
1, sunny, hot, high, weak, no\\
2, sunny, hot, high, strong, no\\

The above values use the space and comma's to separate the data. Here each component of the string is used to separate the data.


\end{itemize}


\section{Comma-separated values}
\label{sec:csv}

To refer from \cite{Wikipedia_CommaSeparatedValues}(page 1): A comma-separated values(CSV) file stores tabular data(numbers and text)in plain text form. Plain text means that the file is a sequence of characters, with no data that has to be interpreted instead, as binary numbers. A CSV file consists of any number of records, separated by line breaks of some kind; each record consists of fields, separated by some other character or string, most commonly a literal TAB or comma. Usually, all records have an identical sequence of fields.


\section{Identifiers}
\label{sec:ide}

According to \cite{Roberts2000CompleteJava2Certification}(Chapter 1, page 6): An identifier is a name used by a programmer to variable, method, package, class, interfaces or label. Keywords and reserved words can't be used as  identifiers. It must begin with a letter, a dollar sign, or an underscore; identifiers are case sensitive. Identifiers are tokens (also called symbols) which name as language entities. Each variable has a name by which it is identified in the program.

\section{Decision Tree}
According to \cite{Mitchell1997MachineLearning}(page 59,Chapter 3): Training set : In machine learning training sets are generally called as tables, where each row in the table represents a single training example. 

To illustrate the operation of ID3, we consider the learning task represented by the example training set given in Figure \ref{fig:trainingplaytennis}. We have four attributes Outlook, Temperature, Humidity and Wind. The target attribute is called PlayTennis, which has values boolean value \texttt{yes} or \texttt{no} for different Saturday mornings, is to be predicted based on other attributes of the morning in question.
